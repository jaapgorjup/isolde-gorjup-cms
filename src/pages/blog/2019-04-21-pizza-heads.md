We all know the quote "I love you to the moon and back" which you can find on t-shirts and on a mum's Facebook page, with a minion picture photoshopped underneath it. It's just a cheesy quote, right? Well, that's what I thought before I did some research myself. 

So, how many gallons of gasoline are used to travel to the moon and back? 2000 gallons. The heart pumps the equivalent amount a day! So that means when someone says "I love you to the moon and back" they're saying "I love you every time my heart beats" which is constantly.
