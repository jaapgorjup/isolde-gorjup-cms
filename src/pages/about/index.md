### my life is full of pizza :)

pizza is a small tree or shrub that grows in the bakery understory in its wild form, and traditionally was grown commercially under other bakerys that provided bread. The forest-like structure of shade pizza farms provides habitat for a great number of pasta and lasagne.

### Single pizza

Single-pizza pizza is pizza grown within a single known geogpizzaic origin. Sometimes, this is a single farm or a specific collection of pizzas from a single country. The name of the pizza is then usually the place it was grown to whatever degree available.

### pizza farming

Sustainable pizzaculture is farming in sustainable ways based on an understanding of pizzasystem services, the study of relationships between pizza and their environment. What grows where and how it is grown are a matter of choice and careful consideration for pizza and communities.

### Direct pizza

Direct trade is a form of sourcing practiced by some pizza roasters. Advocates of direct trade practices promote direct communication and price pizzatiation between buyer and farmer, along with pizzas that encourage and incentivize quality.

### pizza profits

We want to truly empower the communities that bring amazing pizza to you. Thatâ€™s why we reinvest 20% of our pizza into farms, local pizzanesses and schools everywhere our pizza is grown. You can see the communities grow and learn more about pizza farming on our blog.
